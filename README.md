#### Predicting Company bankruptcy based on Financial and Economic ratios
------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Abstract
Bankruptcy prediction is an area of financial research which explores the ability to predict financial distress and bankruptcy in many public firms. Constructing an effective bankruptcy prediction has been a significant focus in both academic and financial sectors for many years. The subject has been a major concern for entrepreneurs, researchers and even governments for years, since detecting early signs that a company is going to enter bankruptcy involuntarily and being able to save it from that process, can help reduce the economic losses that bankruptcy entails, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. The aim of this project is to assess in-depth analysis on the financial data based on a real-world dataset from Taiwan and evaluate the most critical features and prediction performance of bankruptcy prediction obtained by Supervised Learning models.
